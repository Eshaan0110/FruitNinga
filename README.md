#  Fruit Ninja — Hand Tracking Edition

A real-time, computer-vision take on the classic Fruit Ninja game. Use your **index finger** as the blade — detected live through your webcam — to slice fruits before they escape the screen.

Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.

## Demo

> Point your index finger at the colored circles flying across the screen and slice through them!

## Features

-  **Real-time hand tracking** via MediaPipe (no controller needed)
-  **Randomised fruit spawning** with colorful circles
-  **Dynamic difficulty** — speed and spawn rate increase every 1 000 points
-  **Slash trail** that follows your fingertip
-  **Live HUD** showing Score, Lives, Level, and FPS

## How It Works

1. **Webcam feed** is captured and horizontally flipped (mirror mode).  
2. **MediaPipe Hands** detects landmark #8 — the index fingertip.  
3. The fingertip position is compared against every active fruit using Euclidean distance; a hit is registered when the distance is smaller than the fruit radius.  
4. A **polyline trail** is drawn by keeping a rolling buffer of recent fingertip positions.  
5. Difficulty scales by increasing vertical speed and spawn rate at each 1 000-point milestone.
